Compact form builder. Creates dynamic forms, calculators, online stores, cloneable fields, tree structures, polls, quizzes, support forms, step-by-step forms and more.

== Description ==

Functional forms plugin for beginners and advanced users. The plugin managed to combine compactness with great features. Quick to set up and operate. It includes many ready-made widgets: conditional fields without nesting level restrictions, step-by-step interface, cloned fields, cool shopping cart, ajax modal form, flexible tabs etc. See more on the [developer's site](https://plasma-web.ru/en/dev/quickform3).

This plugin is aimed at those who want to create a beautiful form with their own design, and are ready to work with a css file. Examples of simple forms are created during installation.

This is a really fast plugin that does not slow down the site. You can put many different forms on one page and you won't notice any braking.

== Screenshots ==

1. Conditional fields. Conditional fields can have an unlimited level of enclosure and can be either a separate field
or a group. They are compatible with the calculator and other functions. They can be used to output images, scripts, styles, and any html code. All required fields will be processed correctly if they are visible.

2. Cloned fields. The functionality can be seen in the picture. The fields can be arranged vertically or
horizontally. Like all the others, it can be nested in itself or other widgets an unlimited number of times. Supports calculator, dependent fields, and everything else in this extension.

3. Step by step form. This is a simple widget, but in this case it is easy to make it with branching. Create
interesting forms, the logic of which will be determined by the user's choice.

4. Tabs. Tabs can be made vertical or horizontal. QuickForm is able to check the required fields in closed tabs and highlight them with switching to it.

5. Calculator. The flexible calculator is suitable for simple trading calculations and for complex scientific ones. Supports dynamically changing fields and all extension widgets.

6. Interactive form. A good opportunity for those who know how to work with Photoshop. QuickForm is an easy way to make interactive forms. I use conditional fields to overlay images with a transparent background on top of each other. I use only css rules in the dependent fields so that there is no image twitching.
